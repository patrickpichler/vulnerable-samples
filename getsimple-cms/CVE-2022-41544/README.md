# GetSimpleCMS

This image is prepared to be vulnerable to [CVE-2022-41544](https://osv.dev/vulnerability/CVE-2022-41544).

The admin credentials are (not required though):
Username: `admin`
Password: `admin`

In order for this vulnerability to become useful, the `docker-php.conf` apache flie needs to be
updated to remove explicitly setting. Additionally a `.htaccess` file needs to be copied into the
`/var/www/html` root folder. This will cause apache to ignore the `.htaccess` file in the `data`
folder and allows for an authentication bypass (an admin API key is stored in `data/other/authorization.xml`).

For more details see [CVE-2019-11231](https://osv.dev/vulnerability/CVE-2019-11231).
